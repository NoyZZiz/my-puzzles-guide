            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Military Expedition is an event between three kingdoms, where you have four altars and a center. The top alliances of each kingdom will be competing for control of these altars and the center, trying to gain as many points as possible.</p>
            <p>Depending on the kingdom rules, the top 5 alliances will occupy the four altars and the center. In some kingdoms, one alliance occupies everything due to their active members.</p>
            <p>Each kingdom has its own set of rules regarding attacking, defending, and occupying altars. Some kingdoms may have specific strategies depending on the kingdom’s power and occupation goals.</p>

            <h2>Three Ways to Earn Points</h2>
            <p>There are three main ways to earn points during the Military Expedition event:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Occupation Points:</strong> By occupying the altars or the center.</li>
                <li><strong>Killing or Losing Units:</strong> By attacking altars or defending them, depending on the rules of your kingdom or the altar captain.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Occupation:</strong> Occupying altars or Dragonia points can yield additional points depending on your kingdom’s goals and the strength of your troops.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Occupation Points and Killing Units</h2>
            <p>If you are not in one of the top 5 alliances, you can join any of the top alliances to earn occupation points. Depending on the kingdom rules, alliances will set their own conditions. For example, some alliances might require you to send a certain number of troops like 40k, 50k, or even 100k troops in order to gain fair opportunities.</p>
            <p>You can earn up to 2000 points by occupying an altar for 2 hours. You can unlock the first four rewards just by occupying the altars.</p>
            <p> Even if you're not in the top alliance, joining another alliance can help you collect points.</p>

            <h2>Killing or Losing Units</h2>
            <p>One of the easiest ways to earn points is by attacking the altars or the center. Different kingdoms or altar rules might require different strategies. Some kingdoms may require you to send a minimum number of troops with no heroes, while other kingdoms might allow full rallies with complete squads.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to earn points is by relocating to other kingdoms and attacking the altars. Depending on your troop strength, you can earn all rewards in just a couple of attacks. If your troops are strong, you may be lucky enough to reach your maximum points for the event.</p>
            <p>Defending the altars also helps you earn points as you fend off attacks from other kingdoms, although this may not be as quick as attacking.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Defending Your Altar</h2>
            <p>If your alliance owns an altar, defending it is just as important as attacking it. When enemy players from other kingdoms try to attack your altar, you can earn points by successfully defending it.</p>
            <p>Medals are an important aspect of defending the altar. Medals give different rewards and are crucial to your alliance’s overall score. They can increase the rewards you receive, making defending important as it contributes to both your defense and your alliance’s position.
