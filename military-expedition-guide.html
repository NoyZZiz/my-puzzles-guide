            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Military Expedition is an event between three kingdoms, where you have four altars and a center. The top alliances of each kingdom will be competing for control of these altars and the center, trying to gain as many points as possible.</p>
            <p>Depending on the kingdom rules, the top 5 alliances will occupy the four altars and the center. In some kingdoms, one alliance occupies everything due to their active members.</p>
            <p>Each kingdom has its own set of rules regarding attacking, defending, and occupying altars. Some kingdoms may have specific strategies depending on the kingdom’s power and occupation goals.</p>

            <h2>Three Ways to Earn Points</h2>
            <p>There are three main ways to earn points during the Military Expedition event:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Occupation Points:</strong> By occupying the altars or the center.</li>
                <li><strong>Killing or Losing Units:</strong> By attacking altars or defending them, depending on the rules of your kingdom or the altar captain.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Occupation:</strong> Occupying altars or Dragonia points can yield additional points depending on your kingdom’s goals and the strength of your troops.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Occupation Points and Killing Units</h2>
            <p>If you are not in one of the top 5 alliances, you can join any of the top alliances to earn occupation points. Depending on the kingdom rules, alliances will set their own conditions. For example, some alliances might require you to send a certain number of troops like 40k, 50k, or even 100k troops in order to gain fair opportunities.</p>
            <p>You can earn up to 2000 points by occupying an altar for 2 hours. In the center (Dragonia), you can earn similar points, with a maximum of 2000 points per 2-hour occupation period.</p>
            <p>Occupation rewards can be unlocked just by occupying the altars for a certain time. So, even if you're not in the top alliance, joining another alliance can help you collect points.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Killing or Losing Units</h2>
            <p>One of the easiest ways to earn points is by attacking the altars or the center. Different kingdoms or altar rules might require different strategies. Some kingdoms may require you to send a minimum number of troops with no heroes, while other kingdoms might allow full rallies with complete squads.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to earn points is by relocating to other kingdoms and attacking the altars. Depending on your troop strength, you can earn all rewards in just a couple of attacks. If your troops are strong, you may be lucky enough to reach your maximum points for the event.</p>
            <p>If your alliance is defending an altar, you can earn points by defending it successfully. Though this is not as quick as attacking, you will still get points for successfully defending against invaders.</p>
            <p>Defending is important as well. Some medals can be earned through defending your kingdom’s altar, and different medals can provide different rewards, making defense crucial during the event.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Defending Your Altar</h2>
            <p>If your alliance owns an altar, defending it is just as important as attacking it. When enemy players from other kingdoms try to attack your altar, you can earn points by successfully defending it.</p>
            <p>When your kingdom’s Dragonia is unoccupied by invaders, a special Shield of Grace is activated. This shield makes Dragonia more difficult to attack or occupy. Medals earned from defending altars will be important for ranking and rewards, and they also play a key role in the event's outcomes.</p>
