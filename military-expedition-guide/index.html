                    <p>Military Expedition is an event between three kingdoms, where you have four altars and a center. The top alliances of each kingdom will be competing for control of these altars and the center, trying to gain as many points as possible.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the kingdom rules, the top 5 alliances will occupy the four altars and the center. In some kingdoms, one alliance occupies everything due to their active members.</p>
                    <p>Each kingdom has its own set of rules regarding attacking, defending, and occupying altars. Some kingdoms may have specific strategies depending on the kingdom's power and occupation goals.</p>

                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>There are three main ways to earn points during the Military Expedition event:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Occupation Points:</strong> By occupying the altars or the center.</li>
                        <li><strong>Killing or Losing Units:</strong> By attacking altars or defending them, depending on the rules of your kingdom or the altar captain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Occupation:</strong> Occupying altars or Dragonia points can yield additional points depending on your kingdom's goals and the strength of your troops.</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>If you are not in one of the top 5 alliances, you can join any of the top alliances to earn occupation points. Depending on the kingdom rules, alliances will set their own conditions. For example, some alliances might require you to send a certain number of troops like 40k, 50k, or even 100k troops in order to gain fair opportunities.</p>
                    <p>You can earn up to 2000 points by occupying an altar for 2 hours. You can unlock the first four rewards just by occupying the altars.</p>
                    <p>Even if you're not in the top alliance, joining another alliance can help you collect points.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Killing or Losing Units</h2>
                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>One of the easiest ways to earn points is by attacking the altars or the center. Different kingdoms or altar rules might require different strategies. Some kingdoms may require you to send a minimum number of troops with no heroes, while other kingdoms might allow full rallies with complete squads.</p>
                    <p>The easiest way to earn points is by relocating to other kingdoms and attacking the altars. Depending on your troop strength, you can earn all rewards in just a couple of attacks. If your troops are strong, you may be lucky enough to reach your maximum points for the event.</p>
                    <p>Defending the altars also helps you earn points as you fend off attacks from other kingdoms, although this may not be as quick as attacking.</p>

                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>If your alliance owns an altar, defending it is just as important as attacking it. When enemy players from other kingdoms try to attack your altar, you can earn points by successfully defending it.</p>
                    <p>Medals are an important aspect of defending the altar. Medals give different rewards and are crucial to your alliance's overall score. They can increase the rewards you receive, making defending important as it contributes to both your defense and your alliance's position.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Important Considerations</h2>
                <div class="guide-content">
                    <h3>1. Infirmary Capacity</h3>
                    <p>Having sufficient infirmary capacity is crucial during the Military Expedition. If your infirmary building, time altar, and alliance infirmary are all full and you still have wounded units, they will be permanently lost. It's essential to focus on improving your infirmary capacity if you plan to participate.</p>
                    <p>Ways to increase your alliance's infirmary capacity:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upgrade your infirmary buildings to the maximum level, ensuring you have more infirmary buildings than resource buildings to maximize capacity.</li>
                        <li>Max out your development in research to increase capacity.</li>
                        <li>Invest in the balance talent to unlock more capacity.</li>
                        <li>Evolve heroes like Horus to level 131 to unlock their infirmary cap buff. With a Mythic Energy Scepter Curio and a +8 enhancement, you can gain an additional 200k capacity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. Fast Comeback</h3>
                    <p>You receive a comeback boost depending on whether your kingdom wins or loses the Military Expedition. Winning grants you a 300% training speed boost, while losing may grant you a different boost.</p>
                    <p>However, there's a condition for the boost: you can use it for two days, but only if your might has been depleted by at least 120% due to battle fatalities. This speed boost can significantly help you recover.</p>
                    <p>If you're more focused on weekly events than Ace, start producing troops on Tuesday to take advantage of additional rewards. Keep in mind that having more infirmary capacity is crucial if you want more might.</p>

                    <h4>Tip:</h4>
                    <p>Save your green speed-ups exclusively for troop production. You can earn 400 speed-ups via events if you reach 5,000 points.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Strategic Infirmary Management for "Fast Comeback"</h2>
                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>To ensure you qualify for the valuable "Fast Comeback" training speed boost after the Military Expedition, it's crucial to strategically manage your infirmary. Remember that the boost is often tied to a significant depletion of your might due to <em>killed</em> troops.</p>
        
                    <p>Consider this proactive tactic: <strong>Before engaging in heavy battles at altars, train a small number of Tier 1 troops to fill the available slots in your regular infirmary.</strong> When your regular infirmary reaches capacity, additional wounded troops will be sent to the <strong>Time Altar</strong>. Importantly, troops in the Time Altar are treated as <em>killed</em> for the purpose of calculating the might depletion required for the "Fast Comeback" boost.</p>
        
                    <p>The key benefit here is that troops sent to the <strong>Time Altar can be healed using points earned from your daily quests</strong>, which are generally more readily available than large amounts of resources. Healing troops in your <strong>regular infirmary</strong>, on the other hand, typically requires significant resource expenditure. The alliance infirmary uses alliance coins for healing.</p>
        
                    <p>By proactively filling your regular infirmary with low-tier troops <em>before</em> large engagements, you ensure that more of your higher-tier troops that get wounded will overflow into the Time Altar and be counted towards the 120% might depletion much faster and without the heavy cost of permanently losing a substantial portion of your army. This allows you to potentially heal a larger number of casualties using daily quest points, while efficiently meeting the requirement for the "Fast Comeback" boost.</p>
        
                    <p class="warning"><strong>Caution:</strong> If you don't have your regular infirmary filled and your wounded troops don't exceed its capacity, they will not be marked as killed. Only the permanently lost percentage of your troops (typically a smaller fraction of the total casualties) will contribute to the might depletion.</p>
